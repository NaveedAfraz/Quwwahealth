            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
                <li>Information provided by Customers to support the use of our products;</li>
                <li>Information provided by users (including Children, patients, and fitness center members) in the course of using our products; and</li>

            <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl leading-relaxed"><strong>Information provided by our Customers.</strong> The ALPRO Software requires some basic information about users, such as name, email address, and health-related data. For example, when a healthcare provider logs into the ALPRO Software, a list of patients associated with that provider may be displayed in the application. The ALPRO Software references this information from a database that contains user information (e.g., name, age, gender, health conditions) that the Customer supplied to the ALPRO Software.</p>
            <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl leading-relaxed"><strong>Information collected through our products.</strong> Our Customers use the ALPRO Software to track health and fitness data and provide personalized feedback to users to help promote lifelong health and wellness. Users (including Children) and healthcare providers use our products to engage in a variety of health management activities. This information falls into several different categories listed below, along with examples for each category:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl leading-relaxed">

                <li><strong>System usage.</strong> The ALPRO Software may collect system usage information to ensure proper system capacity for all users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl leading-relaxed"><strong>Information collected from Children.</strong> The ALPRO Software only collects as much information about a Child as is reasonably necessary for the Child to participate in an activity.
